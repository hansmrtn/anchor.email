I believe that for many of us, our email is the cornerstone of our digital lives. Its one of the best ways to communicate and provide credibility online. What's better way to provide a new digital foundation than by getting a new anchor.email? anchor.email should be a familiar email service without questionable practices and advertising. It should provide a new and secure email for all registered users.

## The anchor. project is aimed to provide a foundation for our digital lives. 

I intend to do create anchor. based on 3 main principles. 

- Provide a paid anchor. ad-free ecosystem
  - An email service, anchor.email
  - A social networking page, anchor.page
 
 - No b.s. (i.e. intrusive advertising principles, shady analytics, fake accounts, etc.)
 
 - Be affordable for all.
 
 
 ### Why a paid service?
 
I have a few reasons to believe that this may be the future of many internet services. 

By being a paid social network, anchor. would have a reduced number of fake accounts, no incentive to harvest and sell your personal data, and require a credible identity to register. Just by being paid service, anchor. seems to tackle many issues that plague modern social media. The anchor. project is not intended to exclude _anyone_ based on their ability to pay - everyone should be able to use social media, which is why the anchor. project uses a pay-what-you-want service that just requires a minimum of _ dollars (cents?) per month (year?). 

The goal isn't to get rich - its to build a great digital _anchor_, an ecosystem of foundational tools that we can use everyday. The goal is to build a social network based around connecting people not monetizing them, to provide a simple to use and ad-free ecosystem. Our digital lives are important and I hope this project proves that others think so, too.
